# Tea Inventory System - Manual Test Report

## Test Environment
- Backend: Running on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3000
- Test Date: 2025-06-26

## Test Results Summary

### 1. Backend API Tests

#### Authentication
- ✅ Admin login endpoint working (returns user object)
- ✅ Session management with cookies implemented
- ✅ Dashboard stats endpoint working with proper authentication
- ⚠️ Rate limiting is active (429 errors after multiple requests)

#### Issues Found
1. **Rate Limiting Too Aggressive**: The rate limiter is blocking automated tests after just a few requests
2. **API Response Format**: The API returns wrapped responses (e.g., `{material: {...}}` instead of direct objects)

### 2. Database State
Based on the test runs, the database contains:
- 22 raw materials (1 low stock)
- 17 products (6 low stock)
- Multiple test records from previous runs
- Proper relationships and constraints are enforced

### 3. Frontend Manual Testing

To complete the manual testing, I'll provide instructions for testing the frontend:

#### Admin Testing Steps:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in a browser
2. Login with: admin@teacompany.com / admin123
3. Test Dashboard:
   - Verify stats display correctly
   - Check recent updates sections
4. Test Raw Materials:
   - Create new material
   - Edit existing material
   - Delete test material
   - Verify low stock indicators
5. Test Products:
   - Create new product
   - Edit existing product
   - Delete test product
   - Check inventory levels
6. Test BOM:
   - Create BOM for a product
   - Verify material requirements

#### Production Manager Testing:
1. Logout and login as: production@teacompany.com / production123
2. Test Production Requests:
   - View existing requests
   - Create new production request
   - Complete a request
   - Verify inventory updates

#### Fulfillment Manager Testing:
1. Logout and login as: fulfillment@teacompany.com / fulfillment123
2. Test Fulfillment:
   - View product inventory
   - Create fulfillment request
   - Verify stock deductions

### 4. Automated Test Issues

The comprehensive test suite encountered issues due to:
1. Rate limiting preventing multiple rapid API calls
2. Response format mismatches between test expectations and actual API responses
3. Cookie/session handling complexities with axios

### 5. System Status

Based on the partial tests completed:
- ✅ Authentication system is functional
- ✅ Dashboard and stats endpoints working
- ✅ Database properly seeded with test data
- ✅ Proper error responses for validation
- ⚠️ Rate limiting may be too restrictive for production use
- ❓ CRUD operations need manual verification due to rate limiting

## Recommendations

1. **Adjust Rate Limiting**: Consider increasing the rate limit or implementing per-endpoint limits
2. **API Documentation**: Document the exact response formats for each endpoint
3. **Test Environment**: Consider disabling rate limiting in test/development environments
4. **Integration Tests**: Use a test database and disable rate limiting for automated tests

## Next Steps

To complete testing:
1. Wait for rate limits to reset
2. Manually test through the frontend UI
3. Consider implementing test-specific endpoints that bypass rate limiting
4. Add environment-specific rate limit configurations
