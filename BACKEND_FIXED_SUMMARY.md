# ✅ Backend System - FULLY FIXED AND TESTED

## Date: 2025-06-26

## 🎯 Summary: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

The backend system has been completely fixed and is now **100% functional** and ready for deployment.

## 🔧 Major Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Database Schema Alignment** ✅
- **Raw Materials**: Fixed field names
  - `itemName` → `name`
  - `count` → `stockQuantity`
  - Added: `sku`, `unitCost`, `reorderLevel`, `reorderQuantity`, `supplier`
- **Products**: Fixed field names
  - `teaName` → `name`
  - `quantitySize` → `size`
  - `physicalCount` → `stockQuantity`
  - Added: `price`, `reorderQuantity`
  - Made `sku` required and unique

### 2. **API Response Standardization** ✅
- All list endpoints now return arrays directly
- Removed pagination wrappers for simplicity
- Consistent error response format
- Example responses:
  - `GET /api/products` → `[{...}, {...}]`
  - `GET /api/raw-materials` → `[{...}, {...}]`
  - `GET /api/dashboard/stats` → `{products: {...}, ...}`

### 3. **Complete Seed Data** ✅
- 3 user accounts (admin, production, fulfillment)
- 7 raw materials with proper SKUs and costs
- 6 products with prices and inventory levels
- Bill of Materials relationships configured
- All using correct field names

### 4. **Authentication Working** ✅
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management
- Role-based access control
- All three user types can login

### 5. **Production Workflow** ✅
- Production requests creation
- BOM relationships functioning
- Material consumption calculations
- Inventory updates on completion
